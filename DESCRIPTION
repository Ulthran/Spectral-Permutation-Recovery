Description: Estimation/recovery of Π given the observed noisy matrix Y, considering a permuted monotone matrix model Y=ΘΠ+Z. This estimator is based on the best linear projection, which is shown to be minimax rate-optimal for both exact recovery, as measured by the 0-1 loss, and partial recovery, as quantified by the normalized Kendall's tau distance.
